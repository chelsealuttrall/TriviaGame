A game to help a new prosthetic user adapt to their Pattern Recognition-Equipped MyoElectric Hand.

In Development:

Phase 1) In level one, the user moves myo'd muscles to send different signals and create hand signals displayed on screen. Can allow for pre-prosthetic training since prosthetic hand is not necessary. (Programmed to use keyboard keys when no myo signals to attach; for demonstration purposes).

Future Development:

Phase 2) level two, the user follows mouse, on screen. You see both displayed.

Phase 3) Make level two function scorable. Have timed tasks.

Phase 4) Make level two timed.

Phase 5) Make a car or plane race game.
